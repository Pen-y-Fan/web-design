# Web Design Practice

This is a simple web page, created using Html, css (less), bootstrap and fontawesome as a practice.

## Static site

The website can be viewed by double clicking `index.html`.

## Installation

The website uses `Less` to create the css file, less is included as a project dependency. To install run:

```shell script
npm install
```

## File Watcher

The `package.json` file has a script called `less` which will compile `style.less` into `style.css`. To manually
 compile run:

```shell script
npm run less
```

PhpStorm has been configured with a file watcher to automatically run the script.
